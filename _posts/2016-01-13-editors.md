## Why Not IDE's?

- They bind you to a particular language, and sometimes a platform.
- They prevent you from learning your language's tools.
- Editing productivity can't be transferred to other things.
- Difficult to automate tasks that aren't built into the IDE.

## Vim

- Available on any Unix machine
- Modal editing: keys do different things in different modes
- Keep fingers on the keyboard and off the mouse
- Based on motions and commands, which can be composed together in numerous ways
- Gentle on the wrists, unlike emacs

## Emacs

- Easily configured and extended using Emacs Lisp.
- Not "modal" like vim.
- Tons of available plugins and extensions.
- Easy to automate tasks using macros, custom code, etc.
- Comfortable editor motions.
