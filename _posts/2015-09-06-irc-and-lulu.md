## What is IRC?

- A chat protocol
- **I**nternet **R**elay **C**hat
- Older than the Web (IRC created in 1988, vs Web proposed by Tim Berners-Lee
  1989).
- We host our own [IRC server](http://irc.case.edu)!
- You run a "client" on your computer, point it at our server, and talk with
  other HacSoc people!

## What isn't IRC?

- Private!
    - Anyone can log onto IRC, and possibly log conversations.
- Facebook chat
    - IRC doesn't save messages for you.  If you're not connected, you may miss
      something.

## So why should I use it?

- Great instant communication among HacSoc members.
- Good for getting quick answers.
- Create discussion channels for any topic or class.
- Good experience: some companies have internal company-wide IRC.
- Plus, it's fun!
