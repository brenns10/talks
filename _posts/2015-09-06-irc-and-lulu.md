## What is IRC?

- **I**nternet **R**elay **C**hat
- A chat protocol used all over the world.
- Anyone connected to the same server can chat with others on it.
- We host our own [IRC server](http://irc.case.edu)!

## What isn't IRC?

- Private!
    - Anyone can log onto IRC, and possibly log conversations.
- Facebook chat
    - IRC doesn't save messages for you.  If you're not connected, you may miss
      something.

## So why should I use it?

- Great instant communication among HacSoc members.
- Good for getting quick answers.
- Create discussion channels for any topic or class.
- Good experience: some companies have internal company-wide IRC.
- Plus, it's fun!
